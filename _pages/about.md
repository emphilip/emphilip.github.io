Welcome! I’m a Product-Minded Technologist with a passion for creative problem-solving and impactful innovation. My journey began at an arts high school, where playing the violin in orchestra taught me discipline and sparked my drive for creativity. From there, I pursued Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where I brought unique ideas to life—like my gesture-based door lock, which was featured on the Discovery Channel.

> Innovation isn’t just about finding solutions; it’s about crafting the right solutions for the people they’re meant to serve.

With experience building and architecting applications, platforms, and services for provincial healthcare systems and financial institutions, I co-founded a Healthcare SaaS platform, successfully exiting to pursue new ventures. After my time as a Senior Consulting Manager at EY, I now advise CIOs, CTOs, and CDOs on Digital and IT Strategies, focusing on Data, Artificial Intelligence, Solution Architecture, and Vendor Management.

But at the end of the day, I’m a hacker at heart, driven by a simple mission: to build cool tech. As I often say, "Innovation isn’t just about finding solutions; it’s about crafting the right solutions for the people they’re meant to serve." If you're looking to turn complex ideas into transformative realities, let’s connect.

The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to experience.
